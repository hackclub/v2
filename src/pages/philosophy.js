        Learning to code is uniquely like gaining a superpower: it converts you
        from a consumer to a creator. Suddenly, computers become a tool for
        creating.

      <Lead>
        There’s never been a better time for making: anywhere in the world,
        anyone with a laptop and an internet connection can learn to make an
        app. Building things has never been so globally democratized.

        <strong>The goal of Hack Club is to help you become a hacker.</strong>{' '}
        We want a space at every school where people are making interesting
        things with code, every week. Schools don’t provide that, so we’re
        creating it in every school to make building things accessible to
        everyone.

      <Headline color="indigo.5">Start building.</Headline>
      <Lead>
        Most coding classes teach you programming concepts instead of how to
        write real code—it’s like trying to learn carpentry without any wood. So
        at Hack Club, you learn to code entirely through building things. You
        start with no experience and build and ship a project every meeting.

      <Headline color="blue.6">Learn as you build.</Headline>
      <Lead>
        Just as the best carpenters didn’t learn in the classroom, neither did
        the best programmers. Through our{' '}
        <A href="/workshops">workshops</A>, you’ll be walked through
        building projects. Starting out, you won’t understand how the code
        works, but you’ll build understanding as you go. You’ll get stuck along
        the way, but we’re here to help.

        Hack Club gives you a worldwide community of thousands of other young
        makers to talk to. We’re artists, writers, engineers, tinkerers,
        campers, filmmakers, volunteers. We make things. We help one another. We
        have fun. Join us.
